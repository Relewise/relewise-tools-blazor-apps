# Blazor.Relewise
This repository is a collection of abstractions that make it easier to interact with the <a href="https://relewise.com">Relewise API</a> in a **no-code** fashion using components that reflect over the types of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Relewise.Client">Relewise .NET SDK</a>.

*This is an unofficial tool that is not maintained by Relewise directly.*
